DEVELOPER README
------------------------------------------

The sg_standard template pulls all apps and engines from the app store by default.
This is not good if you want to do development! Instead, you probably want to be able
to get latest from github regularly.



Recommended Core Developer Setup
------------------------------------------

For development, we recommend that you take the sg_standard environment and replace
the locations to point at github instead of the app store. Like this:

Change this:    location: {"type": "app_store", "name": "tk-maya-publish", "version": "v0.0.1"}
Into this:      location: {"type": "github_dev", "name": "tk-maya-publish", "vendor": "shotgunsoftware"}

In order to do them all in one go, just run the following sed command:

> cd starter_configs/sg_standard/env
> sed -i .bak -e 's/app_store/github_dev/g' -e 's/\"version\": \"v[0-9\.]*\"/\"vendor\": \"shotgunsoftware\"/g' *.yml

Whenever you want to 'get latest' on all your stuff, just run the core/scripts/check_for_updates.py 



Doing development on an app or engine
------------------------------------------

If you want to do development on an app or engine, do the following:

* Clone its gihub repo pull it into some local folder
* In the environments, change the location to point to your local repo:

Change this     location: {"type": "github_dev", "name": "tk-maya-publish", "vendor": "shotgunsoftware"}
Into this:      location: {"type": "dev", "path": "/path/to/your/github/folder"}
